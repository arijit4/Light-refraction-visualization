# Light-refraction-visualization
This project helps visualizing [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction) between two mediums by user given [refractive index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index)s.

#How to use
The values from `n1` slider and `n2` sliders are respectively assumed as the refractive indexes of the upper medium and the lower medium of the system.  

__Note : The light rays always point toward the center of the divider__

Adjust the values according to your need and click wherever you want the light ray to begin with.
